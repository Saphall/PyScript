During a keynote speech at PyCon US 2022, Anaconda’s CEO Peter Wang unveiled quite a surprising project — [**PyScript**](https://pyscript.net/). It is a JavaScript framework that allows users to create Python applications in the browser using a mix of Python and standard HTML. The project’s ultimate goal is to allow a much wider audience (for example, front-end developers) to benefit from the power of Python and its various libraries (statistical, ML/DL, etc.).

Trying this out.
